Common types of abnormalities can include developmental anomalies, such as congenital malformations, and acquired conditions, such as tumors or degenerative diseases. These variations can typically be categorized into two main groups based on their nature: structural abnormalities and functional abnormalities. Structural abnormalities refer to physical changes in the brain's anatomy, while functional abnormalities involve changes in brain activity or processing. Thus, the identified abnormalities can be refined to these two categories."
